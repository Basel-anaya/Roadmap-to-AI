# Machine Learning (ML) 
**ML is an algorithmic based approach that learns from training data and give decisions on unseen data. There are many algorithms exists in ML for supervised and unsupervised learning.**

#### This roadmap created by [mrdbourke](https://github.com/mrdbourke), And we will be following every step.

### The beginner path (6–12+ months):

**The machine learning specific parts would be:**

1. Machine learning concepts — understand what kind of problems machine learning can and should be used for. [Elements of AI](https://www.elementsofai.com/) is great for this.
2. Python — the language itself, along with the machine learning specific frameworks, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, Scikit-Learn. Check out [pythonlikeyoumeanit](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/) or [my repository](https://github.com/Basel-anaya/Roadmap-to-AI/tree/main/0-%20Prerequisites/4-%20Python%20Programming).
3. Machine learning tools — the main one being [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).
4. Machine learning math — linear algebra from [3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) or [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/), matrix manipulation and calculus from Khan Academy or just read the [Mathematics for Machine Learning Book](https://www.amazon.com/Mathematics-Machine-Learning-Peter-Deisenroth/dp/110845514X).

#### Alongside these, I’d go through:

1. [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) — for web development skills.
2. [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/college/2020/fall/) + [CS50 artificial intelligence](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhQjrBD2T382Nz7z1AEXmioc27axa19Kv) — for foundational computer science and artificial intelligence skills.
3. [The Missing Part of Your CS Degree](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) — for the parts CS50 misses out on and for coverage of all the tools you’ll end up using here and there anyway.
4. [Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow Part 1](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1492032646/) — covers a vast majority of the most useful and time-tested machine learning techniques.
There’s a lot here. So to consolidate my knowledge I’d build 1–2 milestone projects using Streamlit or the web development skills I’d learned from freeCodeCamp. And of course, these would be shared on GitHub.

### The advanced path (6–12+ months/ongoing)
#### Once I’d gotten some foundational machine learning skills, I’d build upon them with the following.

1. All of fast.ai’s curriculum(s) — practical use cases of many deep learning and machine learning techniques. Watching one fast.ai lecture turned into a solution we built for a client.
2. Any of deeplearning.ai’s curriculum(s) — choose the one which sparks your interest the most. Compliments fast.ai’s practical approach with theory.
3. Full-stack deep learning curriculum — this is where you’re going to tie together the machine learning knowledge you’ve got with the web development knowledge you’ve been learning.
4. Replicate a research paper (or multiple).
5. Hands-on Machine Learning Book with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow Part 2 — TensorFlow focused but the concepts bridge to many different applications.

#### Again, after going through these, I’d consolidate my knowledge by building a project people can interact with.
