# Deep Learning (DL)
It is a branch of ML and deeply learns the text, images, or videos. Unstructured data like images or videos can be processed using DL. There are many applications of DL like Image Processing ( Computer Vision using CNNs), Video Processing (Computer Vision using RNNs), Text Processing (NLP using RNNs, LSTMs ), etc., we can combine with Reinforcement Learning (DEEP RL).

- DL is inspired by Neurons. One neuron gets connected with multiple neurons and applies activation function at the neuron.

Vectors, Matrices and Tensors are objects used in DL area. The Following diagram is the sample of a Neural Network and describes Input, Neurons, Layers, Feed Forward Propagation, Back-propagation, etc.,

There are many Mathematical Subjects involved in Deep Learning, in this article Linear Algebra is considered. Describing how Mathematical objects are being used in each stage.
