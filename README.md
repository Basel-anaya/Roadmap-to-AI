## 0- Prerequisities

To start the journey to become a future Data Scientist, ML engineer, ML devops..etc.
You have to take the fundamentals so they can guide you to start with machine learning.

[Click here to see the prerequisities](https://github.com/Basel-anaya/Roadmap-to-AI/tree/main/0-%20Prerequisites)

## 1- Machine Learning

A roadmap connecting many of the most important concepts in machine learning, how to learn them and what tools to use to perform them.

Namely:

- Machine Learning Problems - What does a machine learning problem look like?
- Machine Learning Process - What steps might you take to solve it?
- Machine Learning Tools - what should you use to build your solution?
- Machine Learning Mathematics - Learn the mathmatics behind every machine learning code you write.
- Machines Learning Resources - Websites, Tutorials, Courses...etc.
